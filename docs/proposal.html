<H5>Summary:</H5>
In many fields, high expectations of Information Technology are
limited in practice mainly by current methods of developing computer
software.
Declarative programming systems in general, and functional
languages in particular, have an important part to play in an improved
software technology. These languages free programmers from the need to
express specific sequences of calculation. They also provide powerful
ways of directly combining component functions. They are inherently
safer than programming languages now in widespread use, and
dramatically more concise.<BR>
<BR>
However, the very high-level nature of functional languages poses two
big problems: (1) how to turn programs into efficient computations; (2)
how to trace programming errors from the faults they cause.
Since the mid 1980s, problem (1) has been a popular target of research,
and excellent progress has been made with it: there are now optimising
compilers for functional languages. But problem (2) has received less
attention, and in practical terms it remains wide open. The lack of tracing
and debugging tools is a long-standing gap in functional-language technology,
deterring potential users.<BR>
<BR>
I therefore propose a decisive attack on the tracing problem for
functional programs. My aim is to advance a successful but limited
prototype, recently developed with ROPA funding, to the stage of a
convincing tool for practical application.
Several research problems must be solved to achieve this aim:
to give just two examples, efficient low-level counterparts must be found for
high-level combinators with subtle properties of abstraction, and
new algorithms are needed for incremental compression of
heap structures to file without disturbing lazy evaluation.

<H2>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Context</H2><!--TOC subsection Past Projects-->

<H3>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Past Projects</H3>The broad aim of my work in recent years has been to advance the state
of the art in functional programming systems, enabling wider and more
effective use to be made of this technology. I have run a series of
research projects in this connection, with a mixture of government and
industrial funding. The most important of these for this proposal have
been:<BR>
<BR>

<H5>FLARE (1991--93, IEATP, GR/F 98857 C2117)</H5>
This project aimed to demonstrate that functional programming systems could be
effectively applied to a range of demanding applications. It was a
collaboration between industrial and academic partners, each of whom
developed applications in their own field of expertise. British
Telecom managed the project.
I was the technical
co-ordinator and co-edited a book based on the project [<CITE><A HREF="#runcimanwakeling95"><CITE>runcimanwakeling95</CITE></A></CITE>].
One important conclusion from FLARE was that the availability of
profiling and tracing tools can be a critical factor in the
successful use of functional programming.
At York we developed novel methods for
profiling heap memory [<CITE><A HREF="#runcimanwakeling93a"><CITE>runcimanwakeling93a</CITE></A></CITE>] and
parallel evaluation [<CITE><A HREF="#RuncimanWakeling94"><CITE>RuncimanWakeling94</CITE></A></CITE>].
There was not time to address the more complex tracing problem,
but it was put high on our list of topics for future research.<BR>
<BR>

<H5>Embedding Functional Programs (1994--, Canon Research Europe)</H5>
Towards the end of FLARE, a separate PhD project at York aimed to
adapt a functional language implementation for the special
requirements of embedded systems, including demands for memory
efficiency and a richer treatment of I/O [<CITE><A HREF="#wallacerunciman95b"><CITE>wallacerunciman95b</CITE></A></CITE>].
CRE has funded a continuation of this work.
The current techniques used for embedding software into
devices such as typewriters and copiers are a long way from purely
functional programming. But there are prototype software systems
developed on large workstations in declarative languages that Canon
might one day wish to embed in such office products. We have been
researching extensions to functional languages and their
implementations to make such embedding possible. A
significant part of this work has been a novel treatment of
compressed binary data [<CITE><A HREF="#WallaceRunciman98"><CITE>WallaceRunciman98</CITE></A></CITE>]:
this could be a useful part of our
tracing technology, where one of the key problems is to
reduce memory demands for trace structures representing entire
computational histories.<BR>
<BR>

<H5>Selective tracing of functional computations using graph reduction with
redex trails (1996--97, ROPA, GR/K64334)</H5>
This 18-month project aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of
a particular approach to the tracing problem by building a prototype
implementation. We extended a compiled graph-reduction implementation
of the functional language Haskell, transforming programs so that at
run-time they could build trails of contracted redexes (intermediate
expressions, re-written by appeal to definitions in the program) 
attaching a comprehensive derivation
tree to every value [<CITE><A HREF="#sparudruncimanplilp97"><CITE>sparudruncimanplilp97</CITE></A></CITE>].
We developed a special purpose browser for the
examination of trails starting from outputs or run-time faults; we
experimented with partial trails and pruning rules to
increase the size of applications that could be handled [<CITE><A HREF="#SparudRuncimanIFL97"><CITE>SparudRuncimanIFL97</CITE></A></CITE>].
This ROPA project convinced us that redex trails can be made the basis
of an effective tracing system, useful in real applications.
<EM>The goal of the project now proposed is to fulfil this potential.

<!--TOC subsection Institution-->

<H3>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Institution</H3>The Computer Science department at York has internationally
known research groups and attracted the highest possible rating (5*)
in the most recent national Research Assessment Exercise.
Software technology, including compilers and related tools,
is a long-standing theme in the department's work.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section Proposed Research-->

<H2>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed Research</H2><!--TOC subsection Background-->

<H3>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Background</H3>
<H5>The tracing problem</H5>
Functional programming systems offer significant advantages over more
conventional alternatives, particularly for complex symbolic
applications. The abstracting power and declarative nature of functional
languages, largely free from low-level concerns such as
sequence of evaluation and memory management, enable computational
ideas to be expressed very directly and concisely, with 
fewer possibilities for error.<BR>
<BR>
However, this property of being abstract is two-edged. Though 
there are fewer classes of possible mistakes in functional programs,
errors do still occur, and programmers need to trace their causes.
Time and again the lack of tools for tracing and debugging has deterred
software developers from using functional languages [<CITE><A HREF="#Wadler98"><CITE>Wadler98</CITE></A></CITE>].
This is not simple neglect on the part of implementors;
a high level of abstraction separating language from machine makes
tools genuinely hard to build.
A computation of a conventional imperative program is comparatively easy
to trace, step by step, but a functional computation performed using a
sophisticated evaluation strategy such as normal order graph reduction
involves a sequence of events not explicit in the program, and often
baffling to the intuition. Hence the research challenges: <EM>What is
an appropriate form of trace for functional computations? How best can
such traces be constructed and applied in practice?</EM><BR>
<BR>

<H5>Approaches to the problem</H5>
In the 1980s, little work was done on
profiling and tracing functional computations.
In the 1990s, work at York and elsewhere has
delivered effective profiling techniques, leading to
marked reductions in the time and space costs of many
applications [<CITE><A HREF="#RuncimanRojemoSchool96"><CITE>RuncimanRojemoSchool96</CITE></A>, </CITE><CITE><A HREF="#sansompeytonjonestoplas97"><CITE>sansompeytonjonestoplas97</CITE></A></CITE>].
Success with the tracing problem has not come so easily:
a review in a recent Australian thesis [<CITE><A HREF="#watsonphd"><CITE>watsonphd</CITE></A></CITE>] notes some twenty
different attempts at a solution, none of them conclusive!<BR>
<BR>
Approaches broadly divide into those that base traces on a <EM>linear
sequence</EM> of events, and those that represent computational history
using some sort of <EM>dependency graph</EM>. Methods based on a sequence of
events have had some success for `mostly functional' languages with a
strictly applicative evaluation sequence; Tolmach and Appel's system
for the ML language is a notable example [<CITE><A HREF="#tolmachappeljfp95"><CITE>tolmachappeljfp95</CITE></A></CITE>].
The benefits of
the sequential approach are that a trace can be displayed as
computation proceeds, and that it is easy to trade time for space:
given a few check-point states stored at well-chosen intervals, any past
state of computational history can be reached by re-execution.
<BR>
<BR>
However, the more ideal purely functional languages 
permit the definition of non-strict functions, implemented using
the lazy evaluation strategy of call-by-need. Despite some valiant attempts [<CITE><A HREF="#watsonphd"><CITE>watsonphd</CITE></A></CITE>],
the evidence to date is that for such programs linear traces of the sequence of
reductions are ineffective. Rather, to track
faults in realistic computations, it is necessary to record a
non-linear structure of dependencies between expressions.<BR>
<BR>

<H5>Redex trails prototype</H5>
In our work, a network of <EM>redex trails</EM> [<CITE><A HREF="#sparudruncimanplilp97"><CITE>sparudruncimanplilp97</CITE></A>, </CITE><CITE><A HREF="#SparudRuncimanIFL97"><CITE>SparudRuncimanIFL97</CITE></A></CITE>]
represents these dependencies.
Functional expressions can be viewed as trees or --- since
sub-expressions can be shared and may recursively reference enclosing
expressions --- as graphs. Evaluation repeatedly replaces one subgraph
by another, where the reduction rules used to define replacements are
derived from equations that constitute the program. At each reduction
step, a <EM>redex</EM> matching the left-hand side of an equation is
replaced by the corresponding instance of the right-hand side. To
construct redex trails, at each reduction during the computation we
arrange that from every node <I>n</I> of the resulting subgraph there is a
link to the <EM>parent redex</EM> whose reduction caused <I>n</I> to be
introduced. Using a special-purpose browser which reconstructs
expressions in source form, the programmer can proceed backwards along
the relevant trails from a fragment of output, from a run-time error,
or from a point at which an apparently unproductive computation has been
interrupted. Our ROPA project has shown the viability of
this approach, as outlined in §1;
but despite its promising results, our ROPA prototype is limited
in a variety of ways, each prompting lines of further research:<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI>
<EM>Performance:</EM>
A program transformed to generate redex trails can run 10--20 times
more slowly than the original.
<EM>Research questions</EM>: Could new abstract-machine instructions
provide low-level replacements for current high-level
combinators to manipulate trails? How can normally compiled functions
be mixed with trail-generating ones, when trail generation alters
type-structure at all levels?<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Capacity:</EM>
Trails are constructed as data structures in heap memory.
Even partial redex trails are very large and current pruning strategies
may discard needed information.
<EM>Research questions</EM>: Could our heap compression techniques be
used to good effect here? Could some form of meta-programming be
used to give greater control over pruning?<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Transience:</EM>
Because trails are built in heap memory, when a functional computation
is closed the trail is lost.
<EM>Research question</EM>: How can trails be archived to file incrementally
as computation proceeds? (This is a delicate problem because of the relationship
between trails and lazy evaluation, and the need to avoid revising the
archive.)<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Scope:</EM>
Important classes of Haskell programs cannot yet be traced.
For example, I/O is very restricted, and comprehensions are traced
in terms of their low-level translations.
<EM>Research questions</EM>: What extensions to the current definition
of redex trails best represent these forms of
computation? What form of access and display are most effective
for these extensions?<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Host:</EM> 
The prototype is implemented as an extension of the <EM>nhc</EM> compiler
and run-time system. It cannot be used in conjunction
with other implementations (eg. the optimising compiler <EM>ghc</EM>).
<EM>Research questions</EM>: How can the current machinery for
redex trails be re-expressed in a portable tracer? If source-to-source
translation is used, could a low-level library with an interface
defined in Green Card [<CITE><A HREF="#GreenCard97"><CITE>GreenCard97</CITE></A></CITE>] or H/Direct [<CITE><A HREF="#HDirect98"><CITE>HDirect98</CITE></A></CITE>] provide
the necessary extension of primitives?
If so, assuming what interface to the local run-time system?<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>User interface:</EM>
The prototype trail browser was developed <EM>ad hoc</EM>.
It is quite complex and using it successfully
sometimes requires an implementor's insight.
<EM>Research questions</EM>:
How can fault-tracing be modelled as a problem-solving activity?
How well do the resources provided by the trail browser fit the task?
How can these and other insights be reflected in improved design,
including greater support for fault-finding strategies?</OL>One consequence of these limitations and outstanding research questions
is that the prototype has had few users --- mainly the developers and
their students.
The obstacles to wider practical use do not seem insurmountable,
but there is a lot of work to be done, requiring various skills.<BR>
<BR>

<H5>Other alternatives</H5>
Though we have developed redex trails as the basis for tracing,
we are aware of alternatives.
Perhaps the most advanced of these is Nilsson's Freja system, based on
Evaluation Dependence Trees (EDTs) [<CITE><A HREF="#NilssonPhd98"><CITE>NilssonPhd98</CITE></A></CITE>]. His EDT nodes record
equivalences between expressions, where each parent equivalence
is a direct consequence of the child equivalences and an
equation in the program. 
The starting point in an EDT is not
a final reduction leading to an output or point of error but
the root equivalence between an original main expression and its
entire computed result.
Two drawbacks of the EDT approach in comparison with redex trails
are that incremental archiving to file is even more difficult
(Nilsson rules it out in favour of repeated execution to obtain
new fragments of the EDT) and that the user has to reason
about larger displayed expressions.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Programme and Methodology-->

<H3>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Programme and Methodology</H3>
<H5>Overall aim:</H5>
a solution to the problem of tracing higher-order lazy
functional computations that is effective in practice, based on tools
for the construction and examination of redex trails.<BR>
<BR>

<H5>Primary objectives</H5>
<OL>
<LI>
a <EM>tracing system for Haskell 98</EM> (the nearest thing
there is to a standard lazy functional language) hosted in
the freely available <EM>nhc</EM> compiler;
<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
a system that incorporates a method for <EM>incremental archiving
of traces to file</EM>, alleviating pressure on heap memory and
increasing the returns from the overhead of generating trails;<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
a <EM>portable variant</EM> of the tracer, based on source-to-source
transformation and a support library, with a clearly-defined
interface to supporting operations that any host implementation
must provide; (In particular, we aim to provide a version of
our tracer that works in conjunction with the widely-used
<EM>ghc</EM> and <EM>hugs</EM> systems, currently being integrated with
EPSRC support --- GR/L 34297.)<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
a trace-browser designed to be <EM>an effective tool for locating
faults</EM> based on a thorough analysis of
the tracing task as a problem-solving activity, and of the
browser display as a resource; the browser will also be
equipped to record how it is used, so that data
can be gathered from use in practice.</OL>
<H5>Secondary objectives</H5><OL>
<LI>
to <EM>improve the speed</EM> of computations generating trails,
for example by transferring the operations of trail-level function
abstraction and application to a lower layer of implementation;<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
to obtain <EM>results from a wide range of practical tests</EM> using the
tracer, and hence to improve the design --- eg. to determine
what strategies users choose to adopt when examining traces, and to
extend the tracer with explicit support for the strategies that seem
most successful;<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
to exploit the representation of redex trails as functional
data structures by devising a system for <EM>meta-programming
search and display routines</EM> specific to an application.
</OL>
<H5>Timeliness and novelty</H5>The need for a tracing tool that can cope with lazy higher-order
functional programs has been recognised for almost twenty years. 
The lack of a tracer has been a key reason for the
surprisingly limited use of a programming technology
with so many advantages [<CITE><A HREF="#Wadler98"><CITE>Wadler98</CITE></A></CITE>].
There are now optimising compilers for languages like Haskell,
and tools for the integration of functional components into
larger systems.
A solution to the tracing problem is overdue.
It is a difficult problem to tackle comprehensively,
but the redex trails approach is distinctive, and with
the results already obtained in the ROPA project
we are well-placed to succeed.<BR>
<BR>

<H5>Methodology</H5>
A lot of work has gone into our ROPA prototype, with promising
results.
We should advance from the given position, not restart from scratch.
The principles of the compile-time transformation,
the functional representation of redex trails, and the
message-passing architecture of the tracer (browser
communicating with functional computation) should
all be preserved.
We shall also continue to work with the <EM>nhc</EM> compiler,
but reducing dependencies on its internal world to increase
portability.
Java was used for the prototype browser, and proved
quite satisfactory.
Though we plan to re-think the browser design, implementation
will again be in Java --- a browser that works well
over the internet could prove useful when we want
to support external users.<BR>
<BR>
So far as practical evaluation is concerned, we do <EM>not</EM>
intend to set up rigorous laboratory experiments scrutinising
tracing `micro-tasks'.
Such experiments would absorb too much effort.
Results from actual use in practice are preferable for our purpose,
but general feedback from casual use might be too vague or sparse.
One kind of evaluation exercise we intend to use
requires two programmers.
<I>A</I> explains to <I>B</I> a correctly working program of
moderate size (around 500 lines) that <I>A</I> wrote some
time ago.
<I>B</I> now secretly introduces several deliberate
errors into the program, of a kind undetected by the compiler.
Given the faulty program, <I>A</I> uses the tracer to locate
and fix all the errors, thinking aloud as they do so.
<I>B</I> takes notes throughout, and afterwards <I>A</I> and <I>B</I> review the
exercise, recording the main issues arising.<BR>
<BR>

<H5>Programme of work</H5>Figure 1 summarises the workplan in diagrammatic form.
From the start, the two researchers will engage in joint 
tasks combining their skills as well as solo tasks
demanding their individual expertise.
Brief descriptions follow for each activity.
<BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=center>Figure 1: </DIV>
<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><OL>
<LI>
<EM>Acquire skill with prototype:</EM>
Both RAs need to become expert users of the
prototype tracer to inform their work developing its successor.
Each will also need to become
familiar with components of the implementation for which they will be
responsible.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Tracing as a problem-solving task:</EM>
Newell and Simon [<CITE><A HREF="#NewellSimon72"><CITE>NewellSimon72</CITE></A></CITE>] pioneered ways of analysing the
human information processing required to solve a variety of problems,
such as chess puzzles. We will similarly analyse the activity of using
the tracer to locate faults in programs. The purpose is to gain
understanding of tasks that must be supported by an improved browser
for redex trails, including strategies that users might in principle
choose to adopt.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Display as resource:</EM>
The display provided by the browser is a critical resource, as typical
redex trails are complex and very large. Using techniques previously
applied to theorem-proving systems, we shall model display information
as a resource for reasoning about programs [<CITE><A HREF="#FieldsWrightHarrison97"><CITE>FieldsWrightHarrison97</CITE></A></CITE>].
The results will inform
the redesign of the browser.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Lift language restrictions:</EM>
The top priorities are list comprehensions and file I/O.
Comprehensions require new transformation rules;
file I/O requires special support from the run-time
system; both require extensions to
the browser interface.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Incremental archiving:</EM>
We hope to achieve incremental archiving by extending trail-pruning routines
applied by the
prototype during garbage collection. Information in sections of
trail deleted from heap memory will be archived to file, with the
continuing stump in the main memory trail recording an archival
reference. Care will be needed to avoid any costly revision of
archived values or undesirable change in the degree of 
evaluation. Archived trails must also be properly linked to all the other
information that may be required by the browser (eg. program sources,
indexed I/O transcript).<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Faster trail generation:</EM>
Trail-manipulating combinators are introduced by transformation
to replace each function abstraction and each
application in the original program. In the prototype, these
combinators are defined in Haskell as part of a
redex-trail library. We aim to define
new primitive operations, perhaps new G-machine
instructions in <EM>nhc</EM>, to make reduction of
these combinators much faster. However, degree of evaluation is
extremely delicate, particularly in the way that saturation of
function applications is handled, and some likely-looking
primitives fail at this point.
The ability to mix traced and untraced modules could give another
route to faster generation of selective trails.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Redesign browser:</EM>
Based on experience using the prototype, and the results of the
problem-solving and resource analyses, 
the trail browser will be redesigned.
We shall try to minimise changes to the
message-passing interface with the Haskell world.
The browser will also be extended to record information
about how it is used.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Devise experiments and instructions:</EM>
Writing instructions for the use of the tracer, including
information about how to carry out systematic experiments,
will be an essential prelude to external use and feedback.
The exercise of writing about use of the tracer should
also provoke further insights into what is needed,
and ideas for development.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Interim release of tracer:</EM>
an important milestone.
All effort will focus at this stage on pulling together the
different strands of development in the first year, to provide a reliable
distribution of the tracer hosted by a version of nhc.
This will also be a good time to visit likely users.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Concerted trials of tracer:</EM>
We shall test the effectiveness of the tracer ourselves using
exercises of the kind noted under `methodology'.
Trials by external users will be promoted and supported
by mailing lists, visits and a workshop.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Analyse usage and revise models:</EM>
Study of the data automatically collected by the browser,
alongside reports and requests from users, will
confirm or alter our design assumptions and priorities.
The problem-solving and resource models will be revised,
and improvements made to the trail browsing interface.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Portability interface:</EM>
A portable variant of the tracer must be detached from <EM>nhc</EM>
in two respects.
Compile-time transformations working on internal representations
must be adapted to generate a fresh source.
Extra run-time routines required by the tracer should be
isolated, specified and defined in portable
libraries (Haskell 98, Green Card or H/Direct).
The portable version of the tracer must forfeit
some sources of efficiency that depend on internal properties of
<EM>nhc</EM>, but an optimising compiler such as <EM>ghc</EM> might
amply compensate for such losses.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Develop support for strategies:</EM>
Typical redex trails involve a large number of interconnecting
paths, and there are various plausible strategies for
investigating faults of different kinds.
Some of these could be directly supported by the tracer ---
for example, reducing display information by blocking off
parts of a trail irrelevant to a specific line of enquiry,
and automatically following any unique continuations.
The choice of strategies to support will be informed by
discussion with experienced users, and examination of usage
logs.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Metaprogramming display and search:</EM>
Redex trails are functional data structures so there is scope for
trace-time computation over them.
For example, displays of some large data structures could be
vastly improved by application-specific rules --- though care
must be taken to avoid forcing evaluation unnaturally.
We also plan to investigate ways of encoding specialised
searches over trails.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<EM>Final release and documentation:</EM>
A Haskell implementation incorporating the new tracer, with
explanatory papers, will be made available on the internet.
Another task in the closing stages will be to finish writing up 
results of our work for refereed publication.</OL>
<H5>Project management</H5>A weekly project meeting will provide a regular occasion to
review current progress and confirm immediate plans. With a small team,
working closely together, these meetings will naturally be informal.
However, written records will be kept to avoid misunderstandings
or things being forgotten.
Interested visitors may be invited to join these meetings,
and regular meetings of the Programming Languages and Systems research group
will give further opportunity for brief reports and discussion.<BR>
<BR>
Once a quarter we shall review progress on the project as a whole,
revising plans if necessary to secure the most important objectives.
We shall also issue a short quarterly bulletin to our academic and
industrial contacts, and any other interested parties. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Dissemination and exploitation-->

<H3>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissemination and exploitation</H3>We shall seek in various ways to encourage both
academic and industrial Haskell users
to try our new tracer, and to participate in its
further development. The plan is to release an experimental
version of the tracer at the end of the first year, as the
common platform for a concerted period of trial use. We shall make
suitable advance announcements on the internet, seek opportunities to
present our work on the tracer at recognised conferences, and 
also hold a one-day workshop at York. Within the UK,
we may visit users to get them started. Besides establishing a mailing list for
general feedback and discussion, we shall publish details of
suggested forms of tracing experiment on the web.<BR>
<BR>
There are several archival FTP sites for public domain implementations
of functional languages. We plan to make the final results of our work freely
available by placing copies of software at these sites, in addition to
publishing papers.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Resources-->

<H3>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources</H3>The appropriate scale for this project has been determined by
comparison with the 18-month ROPA project during which the
prototype redex-trail system was developed.<BR>
<BR>

<H5>People</H5>
If we are to push this tracing technology far enough to
make it really effective in practice, there is a lot of work to be done on several
fronts.
Hence the proposal to hire a team of two post-doctoral RAs for two years.
<BR>
<BR>

<H5>Infrastructure and equipment</H5>
The department of Computer Science at York provides
computing facilities including networking and file-service,
with technician support.
<BR>
<BR>
Each of the RAs will need a workstation.
The two most common platforms for
developers and users of research languages are Suns and PCs.
Of these, PCs offer better performance for the price --- and we
have access to an UltraSparc compute server if a Sun platform is needed.
At the time of writing £2000 buys a PC system including a 400MHz
Pentium II processor, 128Mb RAM, 8.4Gb disk, 17"--19" monitor, CDROM,
network and graphics cards.
Suitable components will be chosen and purchased
separately, and assembled by our departmental technicians.<BR>
<BR>

<H5>Travel</H5>We request funds to participate in relevant conferences. ICFP is the
premier international conference in functional programming; INTERACT is
an international conference with user interface design as a central
interest.
IFL is an established European workshop emphasising
new implementation methods and practical experiments in functional
programming.
The costing assumes that we all attend ICFP
but only two of us attend each of IFL and INTERACT.

We hope to maintain close working links with researchers in Sweden.
Jan Sparud (Gothenburg) worked on the ROPA project, and we value
continuing collaboration with him.
Henrik Nilsson (Linköping) has developed a rival approach
to functional tracing, based on Evaluation Dependence Trees. We propose to 
visit Sweden twice a year.
<BR>
<BR>
Within the UK, we have links with relevant research groups at several
other universities, from Exeter to St Andrews, and with industrial R&amp;D
sites, mainly in the South. We request funds for
visits to discuss the development of the tracer, and to
promote its experimental use.
